# noted

Welcome to noted – an app that allows a user to create an account, login, and build and track their own recommended record collection. 

This collection is designed to log any albums the user has intended to listen to. Once the user has given a listen through, they are encouraged to write a "liner note" – a review of the album comprised of a rating (1-10), a "standout track", and additional personal thoughts. 

Currently, additional features of the app include monthly record recommendations and a compiled playlist of the users' "standout tracks".
